Fix: Validate input or use try/except (advanced)\n\n3. **Forgetting the prompt space** — `input(\"Name?\")` looks cramped. Fix: Add space: `input(\"Name? \")`\n\n4. **Not handling empty input** — User presses Enter without typing. Fix: Use `.strip()` and check if empty\n\n5. **Wrong operator precedence** — `2 + 3 * 4` might not give expected result. Fix: Use parentheses: `(2 + 3) * 4`\n\n6. **String concatenation with numbers** — `\"Age: \" + age` causes TypeError if age is int. Fix: Convert: `\"Age: \" + str(age)` or use f-strings\n\n7. **Forgetting to save before running** — Changes don't appear. Fix: Always save (Ctrl+S) before running\n\n8. **Not testing with different inputs** — Program might work for one case but fail for others. Fix: Test with various inputs\n\n9. **Using wrong division operator** — `/` returns float, `//` returns int. Fix: Choose the right one for your needs\n\n10. **Not cleaning string input** — User might type extra spaces. Fix: Use `.strip()` on string inputs"

ValueError: invalid literal for int()**\n• **Symptom:** `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'`\n• **Cause:** Trying to convert a string that isn't a valid number to int() or float()\n• **Verification:** Check what the user actually typed — was it a number?\n• **Fix:** Validate input or handle the error: `try: age = int(input(\"Age? \"))` except ValueError: print(\"Please enter a number\")`\n\n**2. TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)**\n• **Symptom:** `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'`\n• **Cause:** Trying to do math with a string (usually forgot to convert input())\n• **Verification:** Check if you converted input() to int() or float() before math\n• **Fix:** Convert first: `age = int(input(\"Age? \"))` then `age + 1`\n\n**3. TypeError: can only concatenate str**\n• **Symptom:** `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str`\n• **Cause:** Trying to use + to combine string and number without conversion\n• **Verification:** Check if you're mixing strings and numbers in concatenation\n• **Fix:** Convert number to string: `\"Age: \" + str(age)` or use f-strings: `f\"Age: {age}\"`\n\n**4. ZeroDivisionError: division by zero**\n• **Symptom:** `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`\n• **Cause:** Trying to divide by zero (user entered 0 as divisor)\n• **Verification:** Check if the divisor could be zero\n• **Fix:** Check before dividing: `if num2 != 0: result = num1 / num2`\n\n**5. ValueError: could not convert string to float**\n• **Symptom:** `ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'abc'`\n• **Cause:** Trying to convert non-numeric string to float()\n• **Verification:** Check what the user typed — was it a valid number?\n• **Fix:** Validate input or handle error gracefully\n\n**6. NameError: name 'input' is not defined**\n• **Symptom:** `NameError: name 'input' is not defined`\n• **Cause:** Typo in function name (e.g., `inpt()` instead of `input()`)\n• **Verification:** Check spelling of `input()` — it's case-sensitive\n• **Fix:** Correct spelling: use `input()` not `Input()` or `inpt()`\n\n**7. SyntaxError: invalid syntax**\n• **Symptom:** `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` pointing to input() line\n• **Cause:** Missing quotes around prompt string or other syntax error\n• **Verification:** Check that prompt is in quotes: `input(\"Prompt here\")`\n• **Fix:** Add quotes: `input(\"What's your name? \")`\n\n**8. AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'**\n• **Symptom:** `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'`\n• **Cause:** Trying to use string method on a number\n• **Verification:** Check if variable is actually a string before using .upper(), .lower(), etc.\n• **Fix:** Convert to string first: `str(age).upper()` or use string methods only on strings\n\n**9. OverflowError: int too large**\n• **Symptom:** `OverflowError: int too large to convert to float`\n• **Cause:** User entered an extremely large number\n• **Verification:** Check if the number is unreasonably large\n• **Fix:** Add validation to check number size, or handle the error\n\n**10. KeyboardInterrupt**\n• **Symptom:** `KeyboardInterrupt` when program is waiting for input\n• **Cause:** User pressed Ctrl+C while program was waiting for input()\n• **Verification:** This is intentional — user cancelled the program\n• **Fix:** This is normal behavior, not really an error to fix"

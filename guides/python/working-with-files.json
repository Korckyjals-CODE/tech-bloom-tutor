For text files, you work with strings and lines — the same types you already use."},
          {"type": "text", "content": "**Real-World Examples:**\n\n• **Config files** — Programs read settings from a .txt or .ini file so you can change behavior without editing code.\n• **Logs** — Applications append lines to a log file to record what happened (errors, events, user actions).\n• **CSV-like data** — Spreadsheet data or lists saved as lines; read them, process with loops, write results back.\n• **Notes and to-do lists** — Save and load plain text so data persists between runs.\n• **Save data** — Games or tools save progress (e.g., scores, state) to a file and load it next time.\n• **Reports** — Generate a text report and write it to a file for sharing or printing.\n• **Templates** — Read a template file, fill in values, write the result to a new file."},

Until you close, other programs might not see your changes or you might tie up the file.\n\n**Reading as a cursor** — When you read, Python moves a \"cursor\" through the file. read() gets everything from the cursor to the end; readline() gets one line; readlines() gets all lines as a list. After a full read(), the cursor is at the end, so another read() returns an empty string.\n\n**Writing as appending or overwriting** — You can open for writing (\"w\" — creates or overwrites) or appending (\"a\" — adds to the end). Choosing the right mode prevents accidentally wiping data."},

After a full read(), another read() returns an empty string."},

Fix: Use \"a\" if you want to add without losing content.\n7. **Encoding** — For non-ASCII text, open(path, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\"). Fix: Specify encoding when needed.\n8. **Windows vs Unix paths** — Use \"path\\\\to\\\\file\" or path/to/file; Python accepts forward slashes on Windows too.\n9. **Writing then reading same file** — Open with \"w\", write, then read in same block: read returns \"\" because cursor is at end.

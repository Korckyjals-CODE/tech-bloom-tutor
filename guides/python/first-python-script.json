Think of it like giving directions to a friend, but instead of \"turn left at the stop sign,\" you're telling the computer \"print this message\" or \"calculate this number.\"\n\n**Why does this matter?**\n\nEvery day, people use Python scripts to:\n• **Automate boring tasks** — Rename hundreds of photos in seconds, organize files automatically, or send daily reminders\n• **Solve real problems** — Calculate grades, analyze data, convert file formats, or process information\n• **Create fun projects** — Build simple games, generate random stories, or create interactive quizzes\n• **Save time** — Do in minutes what would take hours of manual work\n\n**In this lesson**, you'll write your very first Python script — a simple set of instructions that the computer will follow exactly as you tell it. You'll see your code come to life as the computer executes your commands, and you'll discover that creating scripts is both powerful and surprisingly accessible.\n\nReady to turn your ideas into working code?

The terminal (like PowerShell or Command Prompt) receives this text and needs to figure out what to do with it.\n\n**2. Windows Finds Python**\nWindows looks at the word \"python\" and searches through the PATH (a list of folder locations) to find a program called `python.exe`. This is the Python interpreter — the program that can read and execute Python code.\n\n**3. Python Opens the File**\nOnce Python starts, it looks for the file `my_script.py` in the current directory (the folder where your terminal is located). If the file exists, Python opens it and prepares to read its contents.\n\n**4. Python Reads the File Line by Line**\nPython doesn't read the entire file at once. Instead, it processes the script line by line, from top to bottom. Think of it like reading a recipe — you follow each step in order.\n\n**5. Python Interprets Each Line**\nAs Python reads each line, it translates your human-readable code into instructions the computer can understand. For example, when it sees `print(\"Hello\")`, it understands: \"Display the text 'Hello' on the screen.\"\n\n**6. Python Executes the Instructions**\nAfter interpreting a line, Python immediately executes (runs) that instruction. If the line says `print(\"Hello\")`, Python sends \"Hello\" to the terminal to be displayed.\n\n**7. Output Appears in the Terminal**\nThe terminal receives the output from Python and displays it on your screen. You see the results of your script's execution.\n\n**8. Python Closes the File**\nWhen Python reaches the end of the file (or encounters an error), it stops reading, closes the file, and exits. Control returns to the terminal, and you see the command prompt again."

If you put `print(\"Second\")` before `print(\"First\")`, it will print \"Second\" first!\n\n• **Interpreting Before Executing** — Python checks your code for errors (like missing parentheses) before trying to run it. If there's a syntax error, Python stops and shows you an error message.\n\n• **Immediate Execution** — Python doesn't wait until the end of the file to run code. Each line runs as soon as it's read, which is why you see output appear immediately.\n\n• **Terminal as Output Display** — The terminal is like a window that shows you what your script is doing. Without it, you wouldn't see the results of your `print()` statements."

In File Explorer, make sure \"File name extensions\" is visible (View tab → check \"File name extensions\")\n\n**Pitfall 2: Forgot to Save the File**\n• **Symptom:** Changes don't appear when you run the script\n• **Fix:** Always save (Ctrl+S) before running. Look for the `*` symbol next to filename — it means unsaved changes\n\n**Pitfall 3: Wrong Directory in Terminal**\n• **Symptom:** \"FileNotFoundError\" even though file exists\n• **Fix:** Use `cd` to navigate to the folder where your script is saved. Use `dir` to verify the file is there\n\n**Pitfall 4: Typo in Filename**\n• **Symptom:** \"No such file or directory\"\n• **Fix:** Check spelling. `first_script.py` is different from `firstscript.py` or `first_script.txt`\n\n**Pitfall 5: Missing Quotation Marks or Parentheses**\n• **Symptom:** SyntaxError when running\n• **Fix:** Check that `print(\"Hello, World!\")` has both opening `(` and closing `)`, and both opening `\"` and closing `\"`\n\n**Pitfall 6: Using Word or Rich Text Editor**\n• **Symptom:** Script doesn't run or shows strange errors\n• **Fix:** Use a plain text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or Notepad++. Word adds hidden formatting characters\n\n**Pitfall 7: Python Not in PATH**\n• **Symptom:** \"python is not recognized as an internal or external command\"\n• **Fix:** Use `py` instead of `python` on Windows, or reinstall Python with \"Add to PATH\" checked"

Check if filename matches exactly (including .py extension)\n**How to Fix:** Navigate to correct folder using `cd folder_name`, or use full path: `python C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\my_script.py`\n\n**Symptom:** SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n**Possible Cause:** Missing parentheses, quotes, or colons; typos in code\n**How to Verify:** Python shows a line number and points to the error location. Look for missing `(`, `)`, `\"`, or `:`\n**How to Fix:** Check the line Python points to. Count opening and closing parentheses/quotes. Make sure colons follow `if`, `for`, `while`, `def` statements\n\n**Symptom:** IndentationError: expected an indented block\n**Possible Cause:** Missing indentation after `if`, `for`, `while`, or `def` statements\n**How to Verify:** Python shows which line needs indentation. Indented lines should have 4 spaces (or consistent tabs)\n**How to Fix:** Add 4 spaces before the line that follows `if`, `for`, `while`, or `def`. Make sure all indentation is consistent (all spaces or all tabs)\n\n**Symptom:** NameError: name 'something' is not defined\n**Possible Cause:** Typo in variable name, or variable used before it's created\n**How to Verify:** Check if variable name is spelled correctly. Make sure variable is created (assigned a value) before it's used\n**How to Fix:** Fix the typo, or move the line that creates the variable before the line that uses it\n\n**Symptom:** Script runs but shows nothing (no output)\n**Possible Cause:** No print() statements, or print() statements are commented out\n**How to Verify:** Open the file and check if it contains `print()` statements. Look for lines starting with `#` (comments)\n**How to Fix:** Add `print(\"your message\")` statements, or remove `#` from commented print statements\n\n**Symptom:** 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command\n**Possible Cause:** Python not installed, or not in PATH\n**How to Verify:** Type `python --version` in a new terminal window. If it fails, Python isn't accessible\n**How to Fix:** Reinstall Python and check \"Add Python to PATH\" during installation, or use `py` instead of `python` on Windows\n\n**Symptom:** Script runs but produces wrong output\n**Possible Cause:** Logic error in code, wrong order of statements, or incorrect variable values\n**How to Verify:** Read through your code line by line. Trace what each line does mentally\n**How to Fix:** Check the order of operations. Verify variable values. Add temporary `print()` statements to see what values variables have\n\n**Symptom:** PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied\n**Possible Cause:** File is open in another program, or you don't have permission to access the file\n**How to Verify:** Check if the file is open in a text editor or another program\n**How to Fix:** Close the file in all programs, then try again.

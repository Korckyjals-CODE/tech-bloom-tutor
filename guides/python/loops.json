Fix: Ensure something in the body changes so the condition can become False, or use break.\n\n2. **Wrong indentation** — Body not indented or partly outside loop. Fix: Indent all lines that should repeat (4 spaces).\n\n3. **Forgetting to update counter in while** — Loop runs forever. Fix: Always change the variable used in the condition (e.g., count = count + 1).\n\n4. **Off-by-one** — range(5) gives 0–4, not 1–5. Fix: Use range(1, 6) if you want 1–5, or remember range(N) is 0..N-1.\n\n5. **Using = instead of == in condition** — `while count = 5` is invalid. Fix: Use `while count < 5` or `while count == 5` as intended.\n\n6. **Modifying loop variable in for** — Changing i inside `for i in range(5)` doesn't change how many iterations run. Fix: Don't rely on modifying the loop variable; use a different variable if needed.\n\n7. **break/continue in wrong place** — Logic error. Fix: Put break/continue so they run when the right condition is True.\n\n8. **Accumulator not initialized** — Using total before `total = 0`. Fix: Initialize before the loop: `total = 0`\n\n9. **Range with floats** — range(1.5, 5) is invalid. Fix: Use integers: range(1, 5) or convert with int().\n\n10. **Nested loop variable name** — Using same name for inner and outer. Fix: Use different names, e.g. i and j."

No accidental infinite loop?\n- while: variable in condition is updated (or break is reached)\n- for: range/sequence is finite\n- break/continue used only when they simplify logic\n\n**4.

Fix: Always add `:` after conditions: `if age >= 18:`\n\n2. **Wrong indentation** — Code not indented inside `if` block runs always. Fix: Use 4 spaces (or 1 tab) for code inside blocks\n\n3. **Using `=` instead of `==`** — `if age = 18:` assigns instead of comparing. Fix: Use `==` for comparison: `if age == 18:`\n\n4. **Missing `else` when needed** — Program does nothing when condition is false. Fix: Add `else:` block for default case\n\n5. **Incorrect `elif` usage** — Using multiple `if` instead of `elif` checks all conditions. Fix: Use `elif` to chain conditions: `if... elif... else`\n\n6. **Not converting input** — `age = input(\"Age? \")` then `if age >= 18:` compares string to number. Fix: Convert: `age = int(input(\"Age? \"))`\n\n7. **Logical operator mistakes** — `if age >= 18 and <= 65:` is invalid syntax. Fix: Repeat variable: `if age >= 18 and age <= 65:`\n\n8. **Nested indentation errors** — Wrong indentation in nested conditionals. Fix: Each level adds 4 more spaces\n\n9. **Forgetting to test all paths** — Only testing one condition. Fix: Test True case, False case, and all elif cases\n\n10. **Comparing strings incorrectly** — `if name == \"admin\":` is case-sensitive. Fix: Use `.lower()`: `if name.lower() == \"admin\":`"

Use editor's \"Show Whitespace\" feature to check\n\n**Error 3: SyntaxError - Using = Instead of ==**\n**Symptom:** `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` or program assigns value instead of comparing\n**Possible Cause:** Used assignment operator `=` instead of comparison `==` in condition\n**How to Verify:** Look for `if variable = value:` instead of `if variable == value:`\n**How to Fix:** Change `=` to `==` for comparisons: `if age == 18:` not `if age = 18:`\n\n**Error 4: TypeError - Comparing String to Number**\n**Symptom:** `TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`\n**Possible Cause:** Comparing string input directly to number without converting\n**How to Verify:** Check if you used `int()` or `float()` to convert input before comparison\n**How to Fix:** Convert input: `age = int(input(\"Age? \"))` before `if age >= 18:`\n\n**Error 5: Logic Error - Wrong Operator**\n**Symptom:** Program runs but gives wrong results (e.g., shows \"Adult\" for age 15)\n**Possible Cause:** Used wrong comparison operator (e.g., `<=` instead of `>=`)\n**How to Verify:** Test with known values and check if results match expectations\n**How to Fix:** Review logic: `if age >= 18:` means \"if age is 18 or older\"\n\n**Error 6: Logic Error - Multiple If Instead of Elif**\n**Symptom:** Multiple conditions execute when only one should (e.g., both \"A\" and \"B\" print)\n**Possible Cause:** Used multiple `if` statements instead of `if-elif-else` chain\n**How to Verify:** Check if you have `if... if... if...` instead of `if... elif... elif... else`\n**How to Fix:** Change subsequent `if` to `elif` to create a chain: only one block executes\n\n**Error 7: IndentationError - Nested Conditionals**\n**Symptom:** `IndentationError` in nested conditionals or wrong code executes\n**Possible Cause:** Incorrect indentation levels in nested `if` statements\n**How to Verify:** Check that each nesting level adds 4 more spaces\n**How to Fix:** Inner `if` should have 8 spaces (4 for outer, 4 for inner), outer `if` has 4 spaces\n\n**Error 8: Logic Error - Logical Operator Syntax**\n**Symptom:** `SyntaxError` or wrong logic results\n**Possible Cause:** Incorrect syntax like `if age >= 18 and <= 65:` (missing variable in second condition)\n**How to Verify:** Check that each condition in `and`/`or` is complete\n**How to Fix:** Write full conditions: `if age >= 18 and age <= 65:` not `if age >= 18 and <= 65:`\n\n**Error 9: Logic Error - Case-Sensitive String Comparison**\n**Symptom:** String comparisons fail even when values seem equal (e.g., \"Admin\" != \"admin\")\n**Possible Cause:** String comparison is case-sensitive: `\"Admin\" == \"admin\"` is False\n**How to Verify:** Check if comparing strings with different cases\n**How to Fix:** Use `.lower()`: `if name.lower() == \"admin\":`\n\n**Error 10: Logic Error - Off-by-One or Boundary Issues**\n**Symptom:** Edge cases fail (e.g., score 90 doesn't get \"A\" grade)\n**Possible Cause:** Wrong comparison operators for boundaries (e.g., `if score > 90:` instead of `if score >= 90:`)\n**How to Verify:** Test boundary values (exactly 90, 80, 70 in grade example)\n**How to Fix:** Use `>=` for inclusive boundaries: `if score >= 90:` includes 90"

You understand conditional statements from the ground up — from basic concepts to creating complex decision-making programs. Every expert programmer started exactly where you are now. Keep building, keep creating, and keep learning!\n\n**What's Next:**\n\nYou're ready to learn **loops** next — another fundamental programming concept that will let you repeat actions and work with collections of data. Conditional statements + loops = powerful programming!"

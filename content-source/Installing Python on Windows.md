**🌱 Bloom's Progression Document #1**

**Topic: Install Python on Windows Terminal**

**Stage Transition: No Knowledge → Remembering**

**Estimated Time: 20--30 minutes**

**Prerequisites: None**

**Goal:**

After completing this activity, you will be able to **identify the main
components and vocabulary** involved in installing Python on Windows,
and **recall the basic steps** in order.

**🧠 1. Mindset Shift**

You are moving from *not knowing anything* about Python installation to
being able to **name what's involved**.\
At this stage, you're **not yet installing** --- just *becoming
familiar* with what the process looks and sounds like.

**🎓 2. Quick Recap (Anchor Knowledge)**

Since this is the first step, there's no prior content --- just
curiosity.

**Prompt:**\
Think about what you already know or have heard:

-   Have you ever seen the word *Python* before?

-   What do you think it is used for?

-   What is a *terminal*?

(Students can write a few guesses --- no right or wrong answers here.)

**🧩 3. Core Learning Section**

**🔍 Mini Lesson: "What does it mean to install Python?"**

1.  **Python** is a *programming language* --- software that allows you
    to write code and make the computer follow instructions.

2.  To use it, you must first **install it**, meaning you copy the
    Python program onto your computer.

3.  Once installed, you can open a tool called **Windows Terminal** (a
    black window where you type commands).

4.  You can check if Python is installed by typing:

5.  python \--version

If Python is installed, this shows its version number.

**🧭 Key Terms**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Term**        **Meaning (student-friendly)**
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  **Python**      A programming language used to create software, games,
                  and automation.

  **Installer**   A file that adds Python to your computer.

  **PATH**        A setting that helps the computer find Python from any
                  folder.

  **Windows       A window where you can type commands instead of
  Terminal**      clicking icons.

  **Version**     The specific release number of Python you have
                  installed.

"You now *know the parts* involved in installing Python.\
Next, you'll go deeper --- learning **how each step works** and *why* it
matters."\
*(Coming next: Understanding Stage)*

**🧩 8. Instructor Notes**

**Common misconceptions:**

-   Students confuse *Python* (the language) with *Windows Terminal*
    (the tool).

-   Students may think installation is the same as "running" Python.

**Differentiation Tips:**

-   Visual learners: show screenshots of the installer.

-   Auditory learners: narrate the steps verbally.

**Topic: Install Python on Windows Terminal**

**Stage Transition: Remembering → Understanding**

**Estimated Time: 25--35 minutes**

**Prerequisites:**

-   Can recall the key terms: *Python, installer, PATH, Windows
    Terminal*

-   Can list the basic steps to install Python on Windows

**Goal:**

After completing this activity, you will be able to **explain what
happens in each step of the installation process** and **describe how
Python connects with Windows Terminal.**

**🧠 1. Mindset Shift**

You're moving from *remembering what to do* to *understanding why it
works.*

At this level, we start to open the "black box": when you click
**Install**, what actually happens?\
You'll focus on **connections** --- between files, the terminal, and the
system environment.

**🎓 2. Quick Recap (Anchor Knowledge)**

Review what you know from the previous stage:\
✅ Python must be downloaded and installed.\
✅ The installer adds Python to your computer.\
✅ You can test it with python \--version.

Now, let's find out *why* each of those steps matters.

**🧩 3. Core Learning Section**

**🌐 Concept Overview: "How installation works behind the scenes"**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Step**       **What You See**     **What's Really Happening**
  -------------- -------------------- ------------------------------------
  **1. Download  You click a link on  You get a .exe file --- a special
  the            python.org.          program that can copy and configure
  Installer**                         Python on your system.

  **2. Run the   You see a window     The installer creates a *Python

  **5. Type      A number appears     Windows looks for "python" using
  python         (like 3.12.5).       PATH, finds the file, runs it, and
  \--version**                        shows its version.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🧠 Key Idea**

The PATH is like a **directory of locations** Windows searches when you
type a command.\
If Python isn't in the PATH, Windows says:

\'python\' is not recognized as an internal or external command.

**🧪 4. Guided Practice**

**Activity 1: "Explain in Your Own Words"**

In the table below, fill in the middle column (What's Happening) without
looking back at the lesson.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Step**        **What You See**             **What's Happening**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterward, compare your answers with the sample explanation above.

**Activity 2: "Predict the Problem"**

You installed Python but typing python in the terminal gives an error.

-   What could be the reason?

-   How would you explain what's wrong?

(Goal: Connect *cause and effect* between actions and consequences.)

**🚀 5. Challenge Activity**

Create a simple diagram (or mental map) showing **how Python, PATH, and
Windows Terminal work together**.

🧩 Hints:

-   Start with *User* → *Windows Terminal* → *PATH* → *Python program*.

-   Add arrows and labels like "command travels here" or "Windows
    searches this folder."

**🔍 6. Reflection & Checkpoint**

Ask yourself:

-   Can I explain **why** adding Python to PATH is important?

-   Can I describe **what** Windows does when I type python?

-   Can I identify **the difference** between downloading, installing,
    and running?

✅ If yes → You've reached *Understanding.*\
❌ If not → Review your diagram and rewatch or reread the core section.

**🔗 7. Transition Preview**

"You now understand how Python connects to Windows and the terminal.\
Next, you'll *apply* this knowledge by performing the full installation
yourself --- following the correct steps and verifying that everything
works."\
*(Coming next: Understanding → Applying)*

**🧩 8. Instructor Notes**

**Common misconceptions:**

-   Students often believe PATH is optional ("It worked once, so I don't
    need it").

-   Some think the terminal "contains" Python --- clarify it's only a
    bridge.

**Differentiation Tips:**

-   Visual learners: draw the file flow diagram.

-   Auditory learners: narrate the installation as a story ("Windows
    searches, finds, runs").

-   Kinesthetic learners: move physical cards labeled *User*, *PATH*,
    *Python.exe*, *Terminal* and simulate the data flow.

**Optional Enrichment:**

-   Show students how to view their PATH environment variable using:

-   echo %PATH%

(Just to visualize what Windows "knows.")

**⚙️ Bloom's Progression Document #3**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

If an error occurs, write what it says.

**Activity 2: "Spot the Problem"**

If you get \'python\' is not recognized, what could have gone wrong?

-   a\) The download failed

-   b\) PATH wasn't added

-   c\) The terminal was closed incorrectly\
    ✅ **Answer:** b --- PATH wasn't added.

Then, try fixing it:

-   Re-run the installer → choose "Modify" → check "Add Python to PATH."

**🚀 5. Challenge Activity**

**Create a Proof-of-Work Screenshot or Log**

-   Take a screenshot showing python \--version in the terminal.

-   Rename it using this pattern:

-   PythonInstall_YourName.png

-   Add a short sentence:\
    "Python installation verified successfully on Windows Terminal."

(Optional advanced step: test pip \--version too.)

**🔍 6. Reflection & Checkpoint**

Ask yourself:

-   Can I perform the entire installation *without looking at notes*?

-   Can I explain what each step does *while doing it*?

-   Can I fix a common error like missing PATH?

✅ If yes → You've reached *Applying.*\
❌ If no → Repeat the installation process on a different computer or
user account.

**🔗 7. Transition Preview**

"You can now install Python successfully --- great work!\
In the next stage, you'll learn how to **analyze problems** that appear
during installation or execution.\
You'll become the person others ask for help when their Python setup
doesn't work."

**🧩 8. Instructor Notes**

**Common issues to anticipate:**

-   PATH not added → \'python\' not recognized

-   Installing for only one user instead of all users

-   Confusion between python and python3 commands

**Differentiation Tips:**

✅ Discuss or write your answers, explaining the reasoning behind each
choice.

**Activity 2: "What Would You Recommend?"**

You are advising a friend who has never installed software manually.\
They ask:

"Should I use the Microsoft Store or the Python website?"

Write a short answer (2--3 sentences) giving your recommendation and
justification.\
Consider usability, reliability, and future updates.

**🚀 5. Challenge Activity**

**Decision-Making Scenario:**

Your school plans to install Python on 24 computers in the computer
lab.\
You must recommend one of these options:

1.  Installing manually from python.org

2.  Using winget with a single batch script

3.  Using the Microsoft Store for automatic updates

Prepare a **short proposal paragraph**:

-   State your chosen method

-   Give **at least two reasons**

-   Mention **one potential drawback** and how to mitigate it

**🔍 6. Reflection & Checkpoint**

Ask yourself:

-   Can I compare installation methods using multiple criteria?

-   Can I recommend a method for a given context and explain *why*?

-   Can I consider both technical and practical factors (like updates,
    ease, and permissions)?

✅ If yes → You've reached *Evaluating.*\
❌ If no → Review your rating table or discuss your choices with a peer.

**🔗 7. Transition Preview**

"You can now evaluate and justify installation strategies like an
expert.\
Next, you'll go one step further --- **creating** your own installation
solution, such as an automation script or a tutorial to help others do
it efficiently."

**🧩 8. Instructor Notes**

**Common misconceptions:**

-   Students think "best" means "easiest." Clarify that the best method
    depends on *context* (e.g., number of users, update needs).

-   Some overestimate command-line risks --- emphasize that automation
    increases consistency.

**Differentiation Tips:**

-   Visual learners: rate each method using star icons or a radar chart.

-   Advanced learners: test each method in a virtual machine and compare
    installation logs.

-   Collaborative learners: hold a "Python Installation Debate" --- each
    group defends one method.

**Optional Enrichment:**\
Show how to use a **PowerShell script** to install Python automatically
for all users:

winget install Python.Python.3.12 \--silent \--accept-package-agreements

Then, have students evaluate its pros and cons compared to the manual
method.

**🚀 Bloom's Progression Document #6**

**Topic: Install Python on Windows Terminal**

**Stage Transition: Evaluating → Creating**

**Estimated Time: 60--90 minutes**

**Prerequisites:**

-   Can evaluate and justify different Python installation methods

-   Understands installation procedures, troubleshooting, and
    environment configuration

**Goal:**

After completing this activity, you will be able to **design a resource
or tool that helps others install Python**, such as an automation
script, illustrated guide, or mini-tutorial.

**🧠 1. Mindset Shift**

You're moving from *judging existing solutions* to *creating your own*.\
Now you'll **design**, **document**, and **demonstrate** your
understanding by teaching or automating the process.

The question is no longer "Which way is best?"\
It's "How can I make this easier, faster, or clearer for someone else?"

**🎓 2. Quick Recap (Anchor Knowledge)**

You already know:

-   The different installation methods and their trade-offs.

-   How to troubleshoot common problems.

-   How to decide which method fits a specific situation.

Now, you'll combine all that knowledge into a creative, useful product.

**🚀 5. Challenge Activity**

**"Make It Real" Project**

Deliver a final product that demonstrates your complete mastery of the
skill.

**Examples:**

-   A PowerShell script:

-   winget install Python.Python.3.12 \--silent
    \--accept-package-agreements

-   python \--version

-   A one-page illustrated tutorial ("Installing Python in 4 Steps")

-   A short narrated video that explains *why* the PATH checkbox matters

Each project must include:

1.  A clear **goal** ("Help beginners install Python easily")

2.  **Instructions or code** created by you

3.  A short **reflection paragraph** explaining your design choices

**🔍 6. Reflection & Checkpoint**

Ask yourself:

-   Did I create something that *someone else* can actually use?

-   Does my project show that I understand the entire installation
    process --- not just one step?

-   Can I explain *why* I made each design choice?

✅ If yes → You've reached the **Creating** stage --- full mastery.\
🎉 You can now install, troubleshoot, and even teach others how to
install Python.

**🔗 7. Transition Preview**

"You've completed the full Bloom's learning cycle for this micro-skill.\
You now think like both a learner and a mentor --- capable of building
learning experiences and tools for others."

**🧩 8. Instructor Notes**

**Common misconceptions:**

-   Students sometimes confuse *re-creation* (copying a tutorial) with
    *creation* (adding their own perspective or solution).

-   Encourage originality: a new explanation, new format, or unique
    context counts as creative synthesis.

**Differentiation Tips:**

-   For visual learners → infographic or video project.

-   For logical learners → automation script or flowchart.

-   For interpersonal learners → mini-lesson or peer workshop.
